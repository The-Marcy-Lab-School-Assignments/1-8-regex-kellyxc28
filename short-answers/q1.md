# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
The regex with the ability to `replace` all instances of a pattern is the `/g` flag, which stands for "global". This means the whole string is looked at. An example of this can be seen in Question 14 with `fixFileName()`, where I am looking for all instances of whitespaces by doing `(/\s+/g)`.
