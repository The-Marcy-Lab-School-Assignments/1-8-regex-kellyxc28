# Question

What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer

RegEx is usually used when there is a pattern being followed for a set of data. It would be difficult to use RegEx on data that has multiple pattern(s). An example of this is on question 8 with `isValidEmail()`. This question was more difficult because the passed-in data had to be broken down into sections to see the different patterns it is following. With RegEx, validating values is easier since it does not loop and check every character.

# Teacher Feedback

Although this is true, using regex makes it easier to do this rather than having to loop and check every single character for a specific condition.
