# Question
Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer
By using `\b`, the program/code takes a look at the beginning or end of a word. In this case, I assume this can be utilized to see if there is a space in the beginning or the end of a word. For example, if there is a space in the beginning AND the end of a word, it can signify that it is a word.
