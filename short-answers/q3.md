# Question

Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer

By using `\b`, the program/code takes a look at the beginning or end of a word for specific words or characters. Not only this can detect spacings in between words, but punctuations as well.

# Teacher Feedback

`\b` will help with finding specific characters and words at the bound of the string, so looking for a word at the beginning or end of the word. So `\b` would find a word even if after the word there is a comma or exclamation not just empty space!
